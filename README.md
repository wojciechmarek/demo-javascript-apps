# Demo JavaScript Apps

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript apps I created to learn the language, HTML and CSS. Some of the apps are based on tutorials, others are my own creations. Some were created years ago, others are more recent. All of them are using vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks or libraries.
