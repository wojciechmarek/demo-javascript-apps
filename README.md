# Demo JavaScript Apps

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript apps I created to learn the language, HTML, and CSS. Some of the apps are based on tutorials. Others are my creations. Some were created years ago. Others are more recent. All of them use vanilla JavaScript with no frameworks or libraries.
